These two .bat should be placed in that "Anaconda3" directory.

In Windows you can copy and paste this location into a windows explorer address bar, to get there:

	%USERPROFILE%\Anaconda3\
	
The two shortcut files can be placed on your desktop or whereever you keep your astroimaging tools.

You can then drag and drop one or more images on the Stellarium_Nebulae_Image_Prep shortcut, or one or more wcs.fits files
on the WCS_corners shortcut, and the python scripts will run for each dropped file.
