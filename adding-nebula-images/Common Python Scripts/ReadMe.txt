These python scripts are the same for all three platforms (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux)

Assuming you are using the recommended Anaconda python, and that you installed it for "you", vs. all users,
you should have an "anaconda3" or "Anaconda3" directory just under your home directory (the directory with your user name
as the name).

These two Python scripts should be placed in that "anaconda3" directory.

In Windows you can copy and paste this location into a windows explorer address bar, to get there:

	%USERPROFILE%\Anaconda3\
	
Place the two .py and .bat scripts in %USERPROFILE%\Anaconda3\
	
Mac OS: Place the two .py script files in the anaconda3 directory, which should be inside the directory with your username.

Linux:  Place the two .py script files in the anaconda3 directory, which should be inside the directory with your username.
